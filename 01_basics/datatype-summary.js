//classification of data types in done on the basis of how they are stored in memory and how they are accessed

// means we do not require to specify the data type of a variable while declaring it
// Similar language called typescript is there which is statically typed language


//  Primitive

//  7 types : String, Number, Boolearn, null, undefined, Symbol, BigInt
