Complete Guide to Scope in JavaScript

üìå What is Scope?

Scope in JavaScript determines where variables and functions are accessible in your code. It defines the lifetime and visibility of a variable.

üîπ Types of Scope in JavaScript

JavaScript has four main types of scope:
	1.	Global Scope
	2.	Function Scope
	3.	Block Scope (Introduced in ES6)
	4.	Lexical Scope (Closures)

1Ô∏è‚É£ Global Scope

A variable declared outside any function or block belongs to the global scope. It can be accessed from anywhere in the program.

Example:

var globalVar = "I am global"; // Global scope

function test() {
    console.log(globalVar); // ‚úÖ Accessible inside function
}

test();
console.log(globalVar); // ‚úÖ Accessible outside function

üîπ Key Points:

‚úî Variables declared with var, let, or const in the global scope are accessible anywhere.
‚úî In browsers, var-declared global variables become properties of the window object.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Function Scope

Variables declared inside a function using var, let, or const cannot be accessed outside that function.

Example:

function test() {
    var functionVar = "I am inside function";
    console.log(functionVar); // ‚úÖ Accessible inside function
}

test();
console.log(functionVar); // ‚ùå Error: functionVar is not defined

üîπ Key Points:

‚úî A function-scoped variable exists only inside the function.
‚úî Trying to access it outside will cause an error.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Block Scope (ES6 Feature)

Introduced in ES6, variables declared with let and const are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible inside {}.

Example:

if (true) {
    let blockVar = "I exist only inside this block";
    console.log(blockVar); // ‚úÖ Accessible inside block
}

console.log(blockVar); // ‚ùå Error: blockVar is not defined

üîπ Key Points:

‚úî let and const are block-scoped and do not leak outside {}.
‚úî var does not respect block scope and is function-scoped.

Difference Between var, let, and const in Scope

Feature	var	let	const
Scope	Function-scoped	Block-scoped	Block-scoped
Can be redeclared?	‚úÖ Yes	‚ùå No	‚ùå No
Can be reassigned?	‚úÖ Yes	‚úÖ Yes	‚ùå No
Hoisting behavior	Hoisted with undefined	Hoisted but not initialized	Hoisted but not initialized

Example with var, let, and const

function test() {
    if (true) {
        var a = 10;  // Function-scoped
        let b = 20;  // Block-scoped
        const c = 30; // Block-scoped
    }
    console.log(a); // ‚úÖ Works (var is function-scoped)
    console.log(b); // ‚ùå Error: b is not defined
    console.log(c); // ‚ùå Error: c is not defined
}

test();

4Ô∏è‚É£ Lexical Scope (Closures)

Lexical scope means an inner function has access to variables from its outer function.

Example:

function outer() {
    let outerVar = "I am outer";

    function inner() {
        console.log(outerVar); // ‚úÖ Inner function can access outerVar
    }

    inner();
}

outer();

üîπ Key Points:

‚úî Inner functions remember variables from their outer function.
‚úî This is used in closures (important in event handlers, callbacks, etc.).

5Ô∏è‚É£ Scope Chain (How JS Looks for Variables)

When a variable is accessed, JavaScript searches for it in the current scope first, then moves up the scope chain.

Example:

var globalVar = "I am global";

function outer() {
    let outerVar = "I am outer";

    function inner() {
        let innerVar = "I am inner";
        console.log(innerVar);  // ‚úÖ Found in inner function
        console.log(outerVar);  // ‚úÖ Found in outer function
        console.log(globalVar); // ‚úÖ Found in global scope
    }

    inner();
}

outer();

üîπ Key Points:

‚úî JavaScript searches for variables inside the function first, then moves to outer scopes.
‚úî This is called Scope Chain Resolution.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Hoisting and Scope

Hoisting means moving variable and function declarations to the top of their scope before execution.

Hoisting with var

console.log(a); // ‚ùå undefined (not error, but no value)
var a = 10;

Hoisting with let and const

console.log(b); // ‚ùå ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization
let b = 20;

Hoisting with Functions

greet(); // ‚úÖ Works

function greet() {
    console.log("Hello!");
}

7Ô∏è‚É£ Summary

Scope Type	Description
Global Scope	Variables accessible anywhere in the code.
Function Scope	Variables declared inside a function can‚Äôt be accessed outside it.
Block Scope	let and const are limited to {} blocks.
Lexical Scope	Inner functions can access variables from outer functions.
Scope Chain	JavaScript searches for variables in the current scope, then moves up.

‚úÖ Best Practices

‚úî Use let and const instead of var to avoid scope-related issues.
‚úî Minimize the use of global variables to prevent conflicts.
‚úî Understand closures and lexical scope for advanced use cases.

#### IT will boost your understyanding of scope( it has a little bit of closures(lexical scope))

function test(){
    for(var i=0;i<3;i++){
        setTimeout(()=>{console.log(i);
        },i*1000)

    }
}
test()
### why this above block of. code differ from below one in output
    function test(){
        for(let i=0;i<3;i++){
            setTimeout(()=>{console.log(i);
            },i*1000)

        }
    }
    test()



The difference in output between the two versions of your function is due to the scope of var and let and how they interact with setTimeout. Let‚Äôs break it down.

First Version (Using var)

function test() {
    for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        setTimeout(() => {
            console.log(i);
        }, i * 1000);
    }
}
test();

Output after execution:

3
3
3

Explanation:
	1.	var has function scope, meaning there is only one i shared across all iterations of the loop.
	2.	The loop executes, updating i from 0 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 before the first setTimeout even runs.
	3.	By the time the first setTimeout executes, i has already become 3.
	4.	All three setTimeout callbacks refer to the same i, which is 3, hence printing 3 three times.

Second Version (Using let)

function test() {
    for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        setTimeout(() => {
            console.log(i);
        }, i * 1000);
    }
}
test();

Output after execution:

0
1
2

Explanation:
	1.	let has block scope, meaning each iteration of the loop gets a new i.
	2.	Each setTimeout captures a different instance of i, preserving the correct value at the time of that iteration.
	3.	The callbacks are scheduled at 0s, 1s, and 2s with different i values (0, 1, 2), so they print correctly.

Key Takeaways

Feature	var	let
Scope	Function-scoped	Block-scoped
Behavior in loops	One shared i across all iterations	New i for each iteration
Affects setTimeout	All callbacks refer to the final i value	Each callback retains its own i

Using let in loops is often preferable because it avoids unexpected behavior in asynchronous operations like setTimeout. üöÄ
