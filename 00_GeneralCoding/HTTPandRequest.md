Everything About HTTP and HTTP Requests 🚀

1️⃣ What is HTTP?

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)

HTTP is a protocol (set of rules) that enables communication between clients (browsers, applications) and servers on the internet. It is the foundation of the web and defines how requests and responses should be formatted.

🔹 Stateless → Each request is independent; the server doesn’t remember previous interactions.
🔹 Application Layer Protocol → Works on top of TCP/IP.
🔹 Uses URLs → Every request is sent to a specific endpoint (URL).
🔹 Methods (Verbs) → Defines the type of request (GET, POST, etc.).

2️⃣ What is an HTTP Request?

An HTTP request is a message sent by the client (browser, app, etc.) to a web server asking for some action (like fetching a webpage or submitting a form).

🔹 Sent using TCP/IP.
🔹 Contains details like method, URL, headers, and body (optional).

3️⃣ HTTP Request Format

An HTTP request consists of four key parts:

1️⃣ Request Line → Defines method, resource (URL), and HTTP version.
2️⃣ Headers → Contains metadata (content type, authentication, etc.).
3️⃣ Body (Optional) → Data sent in POST/PUT requests (JSON, XML, etc.).
4️⃣ Blank Line → A separator between headers and body.

Example HTTP Request Format (Raw Text)

POST /api/users HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
Content-Length: 51

{
  "name": "Sumit",
  "email": "sumit@example.com"
}

🔹 POST → HTTP method
🔹 /api/users → Resource (endpoint)
🔹 HTTP/1.1 → Protocol version
🔹 Headers → Additional information
🔹 Body → JSON data sent to the server

4️⃣ HTTP Request Methods (Verbs)

Method	        Purpose	            Example
GET	            Retrieve data	    GET /users
POST	        Send new data	    POST /users
PUT	         Update existing data	PUT /users/1
PATCH	    Partially update data	PATCH /users/1
DELETE	       Remove data	        DELETE /users/1

5️⃣ HTTP Request Headers

Headers provide extra information about the request.

Common HTTP Request Headers

Header	                   purposes        	                          Example Value
Host	           Specifies the domain name	                      example.com
User-Agent	      Identifies the client making the request	          Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0)
Content-Type	 Defines the format of the request body	              application/json
Authorization  	Sends authentication credentials	                   Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
Accept	        Specifies the response format client expects	application/json

6️⃣ HTTP Request Body (For POST/PUT/PATCH)

If a request modifies or creates data, the body contains the actual data.

Body Formats

🔹 JSON (Most Common)

{
  "name": "Sumit",
  "email": "sumit@example.com"
}

🔹 XML

<user>
  <name>Sumit</name>
  <email>sumit@example.com</email>
</user>

🔹 Form Data (Used in HTML Forms)

name=Sumit&email=sumit@example.com

7️⃣ HTTP Status Codes (Response Codes)

After sending a request, the server responds with a status code indicating success or failure.

Code	Meaning	Description
1xx	Informational	Request received, processing continuing
200 OK	Success	Request was successful
201 Created	Success	Resource was created successfully
400 Bad Request	Client Error	Invalid request from client
401 Unauthorized	Client Error	Authentication required
403 Forbidden	Client Error	Access denied
404 Not Found	Client Error	Resource not found
500 Internal Server Error	Server Error	Generic server failure

8️⃣ Making HTTP Requests Using Code

Using JavaScript (Fetch API)

fetch("https://example.com/api/users", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: "Sumit",
    email: "sumit@example.com"
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data))
.catch(error => console.error("Error:", error));

Using Python (Requests Library)

import requests

url = "https://example.com/api/users"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
}
data = {
    "name": "Sumit",
    "email": "sumit@example.com"
}

response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)
print(response.json())

Using cURL (Command Line)

curl -X POST https://example.com/api/users \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -d '{"name": "Sumit", "email": "sumit@example.com"}'

9️⃣ HTTP vs HTTPS

🔹 HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) → Data is sent in plain text (not secure).
🔹 HTTPS (HTTP Secure) → Uses SSL/TLS encryption to secure data transfer.

Key Differences

Feature	HTTP	HTTPS
Security	Not encrypted	Encrypted with SSL/TLS
URL Prefix	http://	https://
Use Case	Non-sensitive data	Secure transactions (logins, payments)

🔟 Summary

✅ HTTP is a protocol for communication between clients and servers.
✅ HTTP requests consist of method, URL, headers, and body (optional).
✅ Common HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH.
✅ Headers provide metadata like content type and authentication.
✅ Body is used in POST/PUT requests for sending data.
✅ Status codes indicate whether the request was successful.
✅ HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP with encryption.
