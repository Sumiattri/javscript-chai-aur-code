JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format used for storing and exchanging data in a structured way. It is easy to read and write for both humans and machines. JSON is widely used in configurations, APIs, and databases.

Why does VS Code use a settings.json file?

In VS Code, user settings, extensions, and workspace configurations are stored in JSON format. Instead of using a complex UI for all settings, VS Code allows you to edit the settings.json file directly. This makes it easier to customize the editor according to your preferences.

Structure of a JSON File

A JSON file contains key-value pairs in a structured way, similar to a Python dictionary or JavaScript object.

Example of a settings.json file in VS Code:

{
  "editor.fontSize": 16,
  "editor.tabSize": 4,
  "editor.wordWrap": "on",
  "workbench.colorTheme": "Monokai"
}

Here:
	‚Ä¢	"editor.fontSize": 16 ‚Üí Sets the font size to 16.
	‚Ä¢	"editor.tabSize": 4 ‚Üí Sets the tab width to 4 spaces.
	‚Ä¢	"editor.wordWrap": "on" ‚Üí Enables word wrapping.
	‚Ä¢	"workbench.colorTheme": "Monokai" ‚Üí Changes the VS Code theme to ‚ÄúMonokai.‚Äù

How to Edit settings.json in VS Code?
	1.	Open Settings JSON
	‚Ä¢	Press Ctrl + Shift + P ‚Üí Type ‚ÄúPreferences: Open Settings (JSON)‚Äù ‚Üí Select it.
	‚Ä¢	Or, manually navigate to:
	‚Ä¢	Windows: C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\settings.json
	‚Ä¢	Linux: ~/.config/Code/User/settings.json
	‚Ä¢	Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json
	2.	Modify the Settings
	‚Ä¢	Add or update key-value pairs according to your preference.
	3.	Save and Restart VS Code
	‚Ä¢	Changes take effect immediately, but some may require a restart.

Why JSON?
	‚Ä¢	Easy to read: Uses key-value pairs with a simple structure.
	‚Ä¢	Widely supported: Almost every programming language can parse JSON.
	‚Ä¢	Lightweight: Unlike XML, JSON is minimal and efficient.
	‚Ä¢	Flexible: Can be used for configuration, data storage, and communication between systems.
